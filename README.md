This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

Than main working branch now is `development` branch until finishing the app.

Most of the app features are done but some features need an Api like uploading images and sending a message.

I used local json file to mock the requests from the back end on messages and conversations list.

The app now can be considered a `beta` version, because there will be more features to be added.

The application is responsive design for small devices.
